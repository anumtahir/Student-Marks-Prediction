# Student-Marks-Prediction
By using machine learning algorithms, we can predict how well the students are going to perform so that we can help the students whose grades are predicted low. Student Marks Prediction is based on the problem of regression in machine learning. Two parameters are considered in this regard i.e. number of courses and time of study.
